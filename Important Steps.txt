Step 1: Explore the dataset (df.info(), df.describe() etc.)
Step 2: See if there are any missing values or not, ideally part of step 1. Don't treat the missing values yet.
Step 3: Split the data into training and testing, and don't look at test set. Parition the test such that the categories are well representative of the full dataset. 
Step 4: Data Exploration using visualizations
    a. scatter plots
    b. correlation matrix
    c. bascially know more about your data w.r.to target variable
